# ReactJS - Book List Application

This project forms part of upskilling and updating my Modern React Skills. This is a ongoing project and will have additional commits as the project develops to demonstrate optimisation of code and performance, as well as further understanding of React principles.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What is the goal of this project

This project showcases understanding of Modern ReactJS understanding and implementation. Throughout I will develop and optimise the code as we progress. There will be multiple phases to this project and continual release improvements demonstrating modern react skills and code optimisation:

1. Phase 1: is a basic non-persistent booklist.
- Houses static elements with ability to create, edit, delete and list books demonstrating understanding of useState and initial React Configuration. However it is non-persistent and not set, so refreshing the browser will clear the list and start from fresh.

2. Phase 2: compromises of persisted book list called through an outside API
- Install and use OpenSource JSON Server for API updates. 

3. Phase 3: Code refactoring using Context system
- Refactoring code with new features. Modernising React build by using Context Systems.

4. Phase 4: Introduction to custom Hooks
- Code optmisation by introducing custom hook. This optimises code by reducing import functions across components and demonstrates basic understanding of custome hooks.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you now need to run two commands to start the project:

### `npm run start` to start React Dev Server[^1]
### `npm run server` to start JSON API Server[^2]

[^1]: 3000 is the Local Host Port. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
[^2]: 3001 is the JSON API Server Port as per package.json. 


The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
